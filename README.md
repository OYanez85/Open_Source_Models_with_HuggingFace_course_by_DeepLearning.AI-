# 🤗 Hugging Face DeepLearning.AI Course Notebooks

This repository contains my personal notebooks and resources from the [DeepLearning.AI course "Open Source Models with Hugging Face"](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/open-source-models-hugging-face/). The course provides practical experience with cutting-edge NLP and computer vision tools using the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course covers:

- Using pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub
- Performing zero-shot learning for NLP and CV tasks
- Fine-tuning models for custom use cases
- Deploying models via Hugging Face Inference API

## 🏆 Why This Matters

These notebooks helped me build a strong foundation for tackling real-world machine learning problems and directly prepared me for participating in the following **Kaggle competitions**:

- 🦜 BirdCLEF 2025: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2025  
- 📸 Image Matching Challenge 2025: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2025  
- 🦁 AnimalCLEF 2025: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/animal-clef-2025

## 🚀 Next Steps

I'll be refining these notebooks and extending them for Kaggle challenges, adding model evaluation, data augmentation, and submission pipelines.
